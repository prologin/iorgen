## Subject

The names used here are often keywords in many languages

### Input

The input will contain:

- On the first line, an integer: **if**, not a condition.
- On the next line, a char: **class**, not a class.
- On the next line, a string of size **8** or less: **i**, just a string.
- On the next line, separated by spaces, an integer **a** (the first letter of
  the alphabet), and an integer **static** (an integer): **in**, not in.
- On the next line, a list of **if** integers separated by spaces: **for**, not
  a loop.
- On the next lines, a list of **2** elements: **words**, contains lots of
  things.
    - Each list element is on several lines: a struct **main**.
        - On the first lines, a struct **system**.
            - On the first line, an integer: **return**, not the end of the
              function.
            - On the next line, a list of **3** integers separated by spaces:
              **void**, not nothing.
        - On the next line, an integer: **if true**, should not cause conflict.

### Output

If this compiles, it is already a good step!

### Constraints

- $0 \le if$
- $for[ ] \in \{1, 2, 345, 689\}$
